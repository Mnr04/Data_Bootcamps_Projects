    "# Car Insurance Claim Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance companies invest significant time and resources into optimizing pricing models and accurately estimating the probability that customers will make a claim. In many countries, car insurance is legally required to drive on public roads, which creates a massive market for such services. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, **On the Road** car insurance has tasked us with developing a model that predicts whether a customer will file a claim during the policy period. Given their limited expertise and infrastructure in deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they have asked for a **simple solution**: identify the single most predictive feature from their customer dataset, which can help them build an initial model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to:\n",
    "1. **Analyze the data** provided in the `car_insurance.csv` file.\n",
    "2. **Identify the single best feature** that predicts whether a customer will file a claim (as indicated by the \"outcome\" column).\n",
    "3. Measure the performance of this feature using **accuracy** as the evaluation metric.\n",
    "4. Store the result in a DataFrame named `best_feature_df`, containing the following columns:\n",
    "    - `best_feature`: the name of the most predictive feature.\n",
    "    - `best_accuracy`: the corresponding accuracy score of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will enable **On the Road** to start with a simple model in production, ensuring that they can deploy and monitor it effectively while minimizing complexity.\n"
